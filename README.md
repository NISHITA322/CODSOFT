Hello, This repositary is for my Data Science Internship at codsoft.
Here I write introduction of Tasks that I have done throughout this Internship.

Task 1 : Titanic Servival Prediction
The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket, class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
A model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
Library Used : pandas, streamlit, sklearn
Algorithm : Naive Bayes algorithm
Dataset : https://kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset

Task 2 : Movie Rating Prediction
The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.
A model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. 
Library used : Library Used : pandas, streamlit, sklearn, numpy, ploty_express
Algorithm : Linear Regression

Task 3 : IRIS Flower Classification
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements.
The goal is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
Library Used : pandas, streamlit, sklearn, numpy
Algorithm : Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Task 4 : Sales Prediction
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, advertising platform selection.
The goal is to utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs.
Library used : pandas, streamlit, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib
Algorithm :  Linear Regression

Task 5 : Credit Card Fraud Detection
By analyzing historical data on fraudulent and legitimate transactions, the model learns to recognize patterns and anomalies that might indicate suspicious activity.
Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions.
Library used : pandas, numpy, streamlit, sklearn, sklearn.metrics
Algorithm : Logistic Regression
